# My first computer job
Over the summer of 2019 I worked as a Research Assistant in the Robotic Computer Vision Lab (RCV Lab for short). 
The lab consisted of several masters, phd and post-doc students, as well as myself and another undergraduate research assistant. 

Some of the things I worked on throughout the summer were: 
- A custom stereo-vision system
- Internal C++ libraries to interface with our hardware
- A console application to control a Gantry Robot

I continued working throughout the fall term on the gantry robot project. The requirement was to build an automated data acquisition script, to collect different types of datasets to train a neural network. 
I integrated the gantry robot software with different camera systems, and built some automated sequences for capturing data. Once the software was completed, I helped my colleagues learn how to use the different automation scripts so that we could take turns collecting the datasets.
