# My first <relevant> job
Over the summer of 2019 I worked as a Research Assistant in the Robotic Computer Vision Lab (RCVLab for short). Not only was this the first time working in a position that relates to my degree, this was my first time working in an office in general.

That summer, the lab consisted of several masters, phd and post-doc students, as well as myself and another undergraduate research assistant. 

Some of the things I worked on were: 
- A custom stereo-vision system
- Internal C++ libraries to interface with our hardware
- A console application to control a Gantry Robot

As the summer was wrapping up, we were rushing to finish our project with the Gantry Robot. Unfortunately, we didn't finish it before classes started, but fortunately, my position was extended for the school year to continue working on the project. The gantry project was extended significantly from what we were aiming to implement in the summer. We integrated the console application with various cameras, and eventually built a fully automated data collection system.
