I've been on the Queen's Formula SAE team since the beginning of my time at queens. Every year, we build a new car from scratch starting in September. By April, we're testing our car at the track in preparation for the competition season. 

## What is Formula SAE?
> Formula SAE is a competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The competition is open to engineering faculties around the world and consists of the design, construction, and testing of an open wheeled race car. The cars are built according to strict design specifications that promote safety, performance and engineering creativity. All cars must pass through a 96 point technical inspection before being allowed to compete. 

My heavy involvement on this team has been the best learning experience I've had as an aspiring engineer. Formula SAE gives you real world engineering skills that can't be taught in a classroom. From soft skills (leadership, project management, communication) to more technical skills (3D design software, tuning software, programming) to finally building everything (CNC/manual machining, soldering, welding).
