# My first taste of the start up culture
Over the summer of 2020 I interned as a Full Stack Software Engineer for Acoutera. This was my first formal introduction to Full Stack development, and it left me feeling the most excited I've ever been about technology. 

Our development team included myself, my coworker Ronnie, who was also an intern, and our boss Nik (The CTO).

## `npm run start`
In the first half of my internship, I spent most of my time focused on learning React, Express and Node while building features into the existing website. This included a mix of both front-end and back-end development. Our 3 person team worked a 1-week sprint cycle, 
where we would define the feature(s) we wanted to implement, and by Friday we would be deploying and testing them in production. 

Some of the main features I helped build were: 
- An email service using [**NodeMailer**](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
- A recommendation system
- A webscraper using [**BeautifulSoup**](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [**Selenium**](https://www.selenium.dev/) and [**Google Compute Engine**](https://cloud.google.com/compute)

One of the most interesting aspects of our development was understanding how users were interacting with our site, and performing AB testing with new features. 


## Co-authoring a 3D Design Tool
The second half of my internship was what really piqued my interest in Full Stack development. I helped co-author a 3D design tool which can be found [**here**](https://design.acoutera.com). 

This project was one of the most fun projects I've ever worked on. 

Some of the features I built in the design suite were: 
- Full Backend Implementation with [**NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/) and [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - Authentication using [**NextAuth**](https://next-auth.js.org/)
    - Database schema design
    - Saving and Sharing designs
- Positioning functionality using [**ThreeJS**](https://threejs.org)
    - Room Layout Designs and Implementation
    - Ability to load a variety of 3D models efficiently
    - Custom Javascript Promise Wrappers to improve the UI/UX
- Server-side rendering
    - Pre-fetching and rendering data to improve UI/UX
    - Pre-building static html pages where possible


Overall, this internship was one of the best experiences I could ask for as an Aspiring Software Engineer. It opened my eyes to a ton of technology I'd never used before, gave me freedom to play around with a lot of <i>trending</i> frameworks and taught me about what goes into starting a company.
