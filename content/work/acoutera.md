## My first taste of the start up life
Over the summer of 2020 I interned as a Full Stack Software Engineer for Acoutera. 
Not only was this my first internship working in Full Stack development, this was actually my
first formal introduction to web development in general. 


In the first half of my internship, I spent most of my time building features into the existing website. 
This included a mix of both front-end and back-end development. Our team worked a 1-week sprint cycle, 
where we would define the feature(s) we wanted to implement, and by Friday we would be deploying and testing them in production. 


The second half of my internship was what really piqued my interest in Full Stack development, specifically working with 
experimental libraries. I helped co-author a 3D design tool which can be found here.
