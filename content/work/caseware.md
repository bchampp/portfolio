I'm currently interning as a Software Developer Intern at CaseWare International, where I'm working on the Cloud Platform Team for an 8 month term.

My work consists of Full Stack development using Angular, Java Spring Boot, and a variety of AWS resources.

<!-- I'm still early into my internship, but here are some of <b>my</b> takeaways so far:
- Ask questions. Big codebases can be scary and people are generally happy to help.
- Check the diff! Review your own code before asking someone else to.
- Have `balance` - if you're coding full time, make sure you have past times and hobbies that don't involve screens.

So far, this internship has been a great experience in learning new technologies, best practices, and most importantly, how to collaborate (especially remotely). Working on a big team/project is worlds different than a small team, and I'm still learning how to be an effective team member.  -->
