This project is a serverless integration with the Slack API, allowing users to redirect a chat widget from their website to their slack workspace. 

The motivation behind this project is that any small company can easily integrate this into their website, and now provide a real time support system directly through slack. 

<!-- TODO: Add gif / video here if possible -->
It's currently implemented as a REST API, check out the <a href='https://github.com/bchampp/slack-chat-bot/README.md'>README</a> for getting started.
