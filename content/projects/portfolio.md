# My portfolio
I've gone through 3 iterations of my portfolio website. My first two iterations were good efforts, but I never felt like I had built something I was proud of. This time, I wanted to build something from scratch, that I had full reign over, and allowed me to easily maintain and publish content. 

My first attempt was a static HTML page; I bootstrapped an html template I liked, filled it up with some content and threw it in an S3 bucket.

My second iteration was again, a template I bootstrapped, but this time using React. I built it during the couple weeks I had off before starting my internship with [Acoutera](/work/acoutera). 

To me, these websites lacked authenticity. I don't want my portfolio website to be an electronic copy of my resume. I want it to be a place to experiment, talk about things I'm interested in and properly showcase my projects.

## How it works
This website was built with NextJS, a React framework that lets you do complex things with ease, such as static HTML generation and server-side rendering.
