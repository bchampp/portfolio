This project is a python script to webscrape the LCBO website and feed the prices and stock of various products into a spreadsheet in a specified format. 

This project was done for a friend-of-a-friend who recently opened a micro-brewery. The owner wanted to track how their products were selling in various LCBO locations, in comparison to their competition. 

This project is nothing impressive, but at the time I had no real experience in Python, so I learned a ton!
