LinkUpEducation is an online platform for students to connect with peers in their classes to collaborate on schoolwork. 
Students can register, sign in and view filtered courses to their program and university. Students can join a class, post an ad and view other postings for the course. Contact info will become available once two students match with each other. 

## The Teck Stack
The frontend was built with ReactJS, and hosted with AWS Amplify.

The backend was built using Serverless lambda functions.
