Hello and welcome to <a href='https://brentchampion.com'>my site</a>.

I'm going to use this platform to post about projects, talk about things I'm interested in/working on, and reflect on some of my experiences. I'm also going to continue maintaining this website as a place for me to experiment. I love playing around with new technologies, and I plan on doing so through here.
