This was my first formal introduction to Full Stack development, and it left me feeling the most excited I've ever been about technology.</p>\n<p>Our development team included myself, my coworker Ronnie, who was also an intern, and our boss Nik (The CTO).</p>\n<!-- ![GitHub Logo](/work/banner.png) -->\n<h2><code>npm run start</code></h2>\n<p>In the first half of my internship, I spent most of my time focused on learning React, Express and Node while building features into the existing website. This included a mix of both front-end and back-end development. Our 3 person team worked a 1-week sprint cycle,\r\nwhere we would define the feature(s) we wanted to implement, and by Friday we would be deploying and testing them in production.</p>\n<p>Some of the main features I helped build were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An email service using <a href=\"https://nodemailer.com/about/\"><strong>NodeMailer</strong></a></li>\n<li>A recommendation system</li>\n<li>A webscraper using <a href=\"https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\"><strong>BeautifulSoup</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/\"><strong>Selenium</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute\"><strong>Google Compute Engine</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the most interesting aspects of our development was understanding how users were interacting with our site, and performing AB testing with new features.</p>\n<h2>Co-authoring a 3D Design Tool</h2>\n<p>The second half of my internship was what really piqued my interest in Full Stack development. I helped co-author a 3D design tool which can be found <a href=\"https://design.acoutera.com\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>This project was one of the most fun projects I've ever worked on.</p>\n<p>Some of the features I built in the design suite were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Backend Implementation with <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\"><strong>NextJS</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\"><strong>MongoDB</strong></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Authentication using <a href=\"https://next-auth.js.org/\"><strong>NextAuth</strong></a></li>\n<li>Database schema design</li>\n<li>Saving and Sharing designs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Positioning functionality using <a href=\"https://threejs.org\"><strong>ThreeJS</strong></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Room Layout Designs and Implementation</li>\n<li>Ability to load a variety of 3D models efficiently</li>\n<li>Custom Javascript Promise Wrappers to improve the UI/UX</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Server-side rendering\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-fetching and rendering data to improve UI/UX</li>\n<li>Pre-building static html pages where possible</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, this internship was one of the best experiences I could ask for as an Aspiring Software Engineer. It opened my eyes to a ton of technology I'd never used before, gave me freedom to play around with a lot of <i>trending</i> frameworks and taught me about what goes into starting a company.</p>\n","title":"Acoutera","startDate":"2020-05-01","endDate":"2020-08-31","image":"/work/banner.png","tags":["react","express","mongodb","node"],"subtitle":"Software Engineering Intern","type":"work","exists":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
