{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"caseware","contentHtml":"<h1>My Formal Internship Year</h1>\n<p>I'm currently a Software Developer Intern at CaseWare International, where I'm working on the Cloud Platform Team for an 8 month term. The Cloud Platform Team is in the process of building <i>Cloud 2.0</i>, a web-based version of one of CaseWares flagship softwares.</p>\n<p>My work consists of Full Stack development using Angular, Java Spring Boot, and a variety of AWS resources.</p>\n<!-- I'm still early into my internship, but here are some of <b>my</b> takeaways so far: \r\n- Ask questions. Big codebases can be scary and people are generally happy to help.\r\n- Check the diff! Review your own code before asking someone else to. \r\n- Have `balance` - if you're coding full time, make sure you have past times and hobbies that don't involve screens.\r\n\r\nSo far, this internship has been a great experience in learning new technologies, best practices, and most importantly, how to collaborate (especially remotely). Working on a big team/project is worlds different than a small team, and I'm still learning how to be an effective team member.  -->\n","title":"CaseWare International","startDate":"2020-09-08","endDate":"present","image":"/work/caseware.png","tags":["java","typescript","aws","angular"],"subtitle":"Software Developer Intern","type":"work","exists":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
