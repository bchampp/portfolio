{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"grocery-smart","contentHtml":"<p>GrocerySmart is a webapp for users to track their grocery consumption, and get reminders when their food is going bad. Users can register, sign in and start building their own grocery lists.</p>\n<p><i>Have you ever bought some type of food, put it away in your fridge, and then completely forgot about it?</i></p>\n<p>If your answer is yes, then grocery-smart would benefit you. The idea is that grocery-smart keeps an inventory of your groceries for you, and reminds you when your food is going to go bad.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/projects/grocerysmart/grocerysmart.png\" alt=\"GrocerySmart\"></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The main inspiration behind this project was to reduce food waste. Did you know that <a href='https://lovefoodhatewaste.ca/about/food-waste/'>the average Canadian household throws out <b>140 kilograms</b> of food every year?</a> This is a serious problem, and GrocerySmart intends to reduce that. Moreover, for people who consistently throw out bad food at the end of the week, this is a means to save money. That average 140 kilograms equates to nearly $1100 in food waste per year!</p>\n<p>For university students starting to live the adult life, money can be tight. Every dollar counts, and every wasted dollar counts even more. GrocerySmart is targetted primarily at University students who are entering their adult lives; where buying your own groceries is a new weekly chore.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>Although GrocerySmart is a very simple webapp, there are a few features that make it a valuable product.</p>\n<h3>Shared Lists</h3>\n<p>GrocerySmart supports building shared lists. So you can share your grocery list with your roommates, and everyone can contribute to the list. This makes it easy to do house grocery shopping.</p>\n<h3>Inventory</h3>\n<p>GrocerySmart allows you to update your inventory after grocery shopping. The idea behind this is to create a reference point for the notification system. If you just got back from grocery shopping and updated your inventory, new foods are 0 days old. As time progresses, GrocerySmart compares how long you've had your food against how long it will stay good. If your food becomes at risk of going bad, it will send you notifications.</p>\n<h3>Notifications</h3>\n<p>GrocerySmart sends email notifications when food is going to go bad. This is a simple way to remind you to cook that chicken you bought 5 days ago!</p>\n","title":"GrocerySmart","startDate":"2020-02-01","endDate":"2020-04-01","subtitle":"A webapp for tracking food consumption and waste","tags":["react","webapp"],"type":"projects","github":"https://github.com/bchampp/grocery-smart","exists":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
