<h3>Year 1 | Q18 - General Team Member</h3>
<p>My first year on the team wasn't very eventful. Between being a rookie and lacking some important design skills, I wasn't given much work. I spent most of my time hanging around the shop and helping out as needed. A lot of my time was spent in the <a>Dyno Lab</a>, where I would hang out and listen to the senior members talk about <b>tuning</b> and <b>engines</b>, and occasionally get asked for a hand.
In second semester, after I had completed my first year <i>Intro to Programming</i> course, I was tasked with recalibrating various sensors as we were getting the car ready for the track. Despite this being a non-critical (and easy) task, I was excited to do something useful! I set up some testbenches, wrote some Arduino code and plotted some graphs. Not long after, the school year ended and I moved back home. I never got to see the Q18 car drive before going home for the summer.</p>
<h3>Year 2 | Q19 - Electrical Team Member</h3>
<p>My second year marked a big turning point for my involvement in the team. Now that I was in second year, I kind of (not really) knew things, and more importantly, got assigned a real project off the get-go. I was going to help with designing our new <a>Electronic Throttle Control System</a>. The first thing I worked on was learning how to design schematics and PCBs in <i>Altium Designer</i>, by recreating some simple circuit boards my mentor gave me. In November, we started prototyping the actual control system. While my mentor worked on building the control system, I handled the technicalities (FMEA reports, auxilary devices...etc). One of the key safety elements I worked on was the <a>Brake System Plausibility Device</a>. Mid december, our team decided to change which engine we were going to use. This was a <i>Catastrophic</i> design decision, and we pretty much had to start designing our car from scratch with only a few months to competition.</p>
<p>Second semester consisted of a lot of coffee and even more late nights. From March until May, we (about 10-15 dedicated team members) spent almost every waking hour working on this car. These are some of the best memories I have in my team at queens.</p>
<p>We had our car running on April 21st, 2019. Despite our <i>First Drive</i> goal of April 1st, we were pretty happy given the circumstances.</p>
